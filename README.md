# ❌⭕ Tic-Tac-Toe Game – C# Windows Forms

A classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** (X & O) desktop game built using **C# and Windows Forms**.

This project demonstrates event-driven programming, basic game logic, and UI interaction using WinForms.

## 📌 Project Overview

The game allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe on the same computer.
Players take turns placing **X** and **O** on a 3×3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

The project focuses on clean logic separation, user interaction, and state management.
